# sudoku-generator
A sudoku generator and sudoku app I developed to practice Constraint Satisfaction Problems.
I might have gone a little bit overboard with all of the features in here...

It uses forward checking backtracking for the grneration, and I also added in AC-3 optimization and some CSP heuristics, but deactivated them because they didn't provide any performance boost for 9x9 Sudokus.
